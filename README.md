# bf2fj
A [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) to [FlipJump](https://github.com/tomhea/flip-jump) Compiler.

The compiler was built to be very fast. Moreover, the flipjump programs generated by this project are generated in a way that will keep them very small, thus their compilation into an .fjm file is also fast. 

## Download:
```
>>> pip install bf2fj
```

## Run the compiler:

```
>>> bf2fj hello_world.bf 
  compile bf->fj:  0.008s
```

You can also run the created flipjump program.
```
>>> bf2fj hello_world.bf -r
  compile bf->fj:  0.008s
  parsing:         0.092s
  macro resolve:   0.141s
  labels resolve:  0.035s
  create binary:   0.143s
  loading memory:  0.017s
Hello World!

Finished by looping after 0.739s (337,484 ops executed; 85.36% flips, 98.88% jumps).
```

Note that you can modify the number of brainfuck cells that'll be reserved in the flipjump file, with `-c` / `--cells`.

## Optimizations
This compiler supports optimizations of the generated flipjump code.  

The optimizations are significant. It lowered the hello_world.bf program from 2,900,990 fj ops to 337,484 fj ops (88% faster).

The major optimizations strategies:
- Optimize multiple data ops: `+++++` => `+5`, and `----++-` => `-3`.
- Optimize multiple pointer ops: `>>>>>` => `>5`, `<<<<>><` => `<3`.
- Find zeroing loops, and replace them with `*ptr = 0`. If there are data-ops before it, removes them too.
- `*ptr = 0` + `+5` => `*ptr = 5`.

## Tests:
I've gathered many brainfuck programs, and put them all inside the programs/ folder.  
The tests compile each of them to flipjump:
```
>> pytest --compile-only
```
You can also run the compiled flipjump files (just omit the `--compile-only` flag), but I only added the input / expected-output files to only a portion of the tests, so it won't pass.

## Licenses:
The programs/ folder has a collection of 3rd party brainfuck programs, taken from multiple open-source websites. Each folder under programs/ has a README.md that specifies were the brainfuck files came from, and to whom we owe the credit.
