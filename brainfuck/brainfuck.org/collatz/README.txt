a mathematical function

The layout is 0 i 0 n tn c tc n tn c tc ...
where n are binary digits of the number n, least significant at left, and tn
mark how far right n extends (as far as tn are nonzero); c are decimal digits
of the step counter, and extend as far as tc are nonzero (note that the first
c-tc pair is special, used for outputting the linefeed); and i is where the
input digits are stored until integrated into n.
