The Brainfuck Archive
=====================

This is an archive that contains Brainfuck resources: programs
written in bf, implementations of bf, utilities for handling bf
programs. The resources are divided as follows:

bf-source

	Contains all true bf programs and library-like snippets.
	Some non-bf programs are also here, because they really
	don't fit into any other category.

impl

	Various bf implementations, both compilers and interpreters.

utils

	Utilities for compressing / processing / stripping bf
	programs etc.

compiled

	Some of the bf implementations and utilities, compiled.
	All compiled versions are currently for Ms-Dos.

Not all programs have any notification of their ownership.  If you
find here a brainfuck program written by you without credits, tell
me (Panu Kalliokoski, pkalliok@cs.helsinki.fi) about it. The original
archive was collected by Jeff Johnston.

To submit new programs, email pkalliok@cs.helsinki.fi.
