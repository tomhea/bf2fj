Contest 1 was to write a program which reads one byte and outputs the set-theory
representation of its value. This representation is due to John Von Neumann and
in this version consists of the set-theory representations of all the preceding
natural numbers, concatenated together and enclosed in {}.
(E.g. 0 is {}, 1 is {{}}, 2 {{}{{}}} or {{{}}{}}.)
Entries are below, in form slightly modified from the submission page.
Bertram Felgenhauer won with an elegant 70-byte solution.
