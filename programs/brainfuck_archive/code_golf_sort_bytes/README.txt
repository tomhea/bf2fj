Contest 2 was sorting. In particular, the task was to produce a brainfuck
program, compatible with the general Brainfuck Golf rules, that:
-reads input which may consist of any nonnegative number of bytes with values
in the range 1-255, terminated by a 0.
-outputs the bytes read (excluding the final 0) in ascending order (obviously,
preserving the length of the file and the counts of the individual characters).
Again, Bertram Felgenhauer and I tied, with identical 50-byte solutions.
-Daniel.
